# PotentialPurchaseLoan
Devise campaign with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimum budget
The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. 
This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign. 
The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.)
and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). 
Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
